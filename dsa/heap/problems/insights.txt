priority queue is used to implement min-heap or max-heap
priority_queue<int, vector<int>> pq;
pq.push(x);
pq.pop();
pq.size();
pq.top();
pq.empty();


kth-largest-element-in-a-stream ------------

Identification of type of heap to be used
to find - kth largest element use min heap
to find - kth smallest element use max heap
Two variants - one in leetcode and gfg

k-maximum-sum-combinations-two-arrays ------------

make sure no repetition takes place while implementing it
use a set for it to store pair's indices and take it only when unique

find-median-from-data-stream

balance minHeap and maxHeap
don't forget about case when maxHeap is empty
