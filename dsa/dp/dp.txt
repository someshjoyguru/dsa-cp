How to Identify a DP problem?

When we see a problem, it is very important to identify it as a dynamic programming problem.
Generally (but not limited to) if the problem statement asks for the following:

- Count the total number of ways
- Given multiple ways of doing a task, which way will give the minimum
  or the maximum output.

Steps To Solve The Problem After Identification

Once the problem has been identified, the following three steps
comes handy in solving the problem:

- Try to represent the problem in terms of indexes.
- Try all possible choices/ways at every index according to the problem statement.
- If the question states :
-- Count all the ways â€“ return sum of all choices/ways.
-- Find maximum/minimum - return the choice/way with maximum/minimum output.

Tabulation approach

- Declare a dp array/table
- First initialize the base condition values
- Set an iterative loop which traverses the array
  and for every index calculates.
